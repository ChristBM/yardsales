# Yard Sales :convenience_store:
It is a React.js SPA of a fictitious mini store. The project consists of different views and pages which are accessed using React Router routes.

It uses an API called FakeStore, which is available on the internet and the design inspiration comes from the Frontend Developer course and the React Practical course at Platzi.

The code of the project is our own and in the layout, although it follows the same aesthetics and uses some of the resources of the original design, it is not the same and has a personal touch.

The application works client-side for the most part, taking advantage of the storage in localStorage and sessionStorage of the browser, so that the app follows a flow quite similar to that of a real store with its backend.
